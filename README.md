### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 âœ¨I have decided to take a turn and project my professional future in the field of programming. I am very keen on this area, and I feel that I can build value for people through technology. âœ¨ 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Spanish Army
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Python in the Madrid City Hall
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-pescador-p%C3%A9rez-80b8571b5/
- âš¡ Fun fact: In the year 2024 I will disassociate myself from the army and dedicate myself entirely to cybersecurity
